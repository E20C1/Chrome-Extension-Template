# Chrome Extension Project Configuration

# General Project Information
- This project is a Chrome Extension compatible with both Windows and Mac platforms
- Follow modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices for web extensions
- Use descriptive names for all functions and variables
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between different extension components

# Project Structure
- Organize files according to their role in the extension:
  - manifest.json as the main configuration file
  - background scripts in root or scripts/ directory
  - content scripts in the content/ directory
  - popup interface in the popup/ directory
  - options page in the options/ directory
  - assets (images, icons) in their respective directories

# Code Style & Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces preferred)
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files
- Use semantic HTML for popup and options pages

# Extension Specific Guidelines
- Keep the manifest.json file up-to-date with Chrome's latest requirements
- Minimize permissions to only what the extension actually needs
- Use event-driven programming for background scripts
- Implement proper message passing between different extension components
- Cache data appropriately to minimize storage API usage

# Cross-Browser Compatibility
- Design with compatibility for both Chrome and Firefox in mind
- Use WebExtension APIs rather than browser-specific implementations
- Test on both Windows and Mac platforms
- Implement graceful fallbacks for unsupported features

# Build & Development
- Use npm as the package manager
- Output built files to a dist/ directory
- Configure hot reload for faster development
- Set up the development server on port 3000
- Create a production build that zips the extension for distribution

# Testing & Quality
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Test the extension in both normal and incognito modes
- Verify that the extension works across different Chrome versions
- Use ESLint for code quality checks
